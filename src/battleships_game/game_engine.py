Game Engine Module:

This module runs a game where the player tries to sink battleships on a pre-set board.

	Modules:
		- components: Creates the ships and board, placing the ships on the board.
		- logging: Allows us to log any errors.
		
    Functions:
    	- attack()
    	- cli_coordinates_input()
    	- simple_game_loop()
    
    It also uses functions from the components module.

    Processes an attack on the board at the coordinates to see if it hit the ship.
